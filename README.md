All the contents of the project is within the zip file. This was a partner project, but because the repository was within a school organization, I couldn't make the repository public. I have moved all the content to here. 

Notes: My partner in this project completed the Tilt section of the project. I completed the breadth first search solver and the Tip Over part of the project.

This project is building a GUI for the board game Tip Over and Tilt. Me and my partner utilized java fx to do so. All other documentaton is with the code.
